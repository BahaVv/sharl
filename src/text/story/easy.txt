You're unsure why it was, exactly, that you decided to explore this cave in particular, but you've come to the conclusion that it was probably unwise.

It's not the distinct howling sound of the wind that drove you to this thought, nor the sound of your heart pounding in your chest, nor even the scattered piles of bones you're more frequently finding scattered about you.

No -- the shadows, occasionally shifting about at the edges of the cone of vision your flashlight provides, are what's making you second-guess yourself.

You had initially guessed it to be a trick of the light, but you're pretty sure, now, that /something/ is here with you. And it's following you.

To make matters worse, you have no idea where you are. An hour or so ago you might have been able to easily find your way out, but not now.

The dull crunch of bone against stone echoes throughout the small chamber you're in, and you quickly jerk the beam of your flashlight toward the source.

The light reveals an empty slab of stone with broken bones scattered about, the edge of a shadow moving out of the light. The brief movement reminds you of the hind legs of a quadrupedal animal.

It's at this exact moment that your flashlight abruptly turns off. You don't have any spare batteries.

Yeah. This was definitely a bad decision.
